MuMoD is a motif discovery tool used for finding motifs.

The following packages need to be installed in order to run NPLB:
 * Python 2.6+ (Not compatible with Python 3.x)
 * python-numpy
 * python-ctypes
 * python-multiprocessing
 * python-re

INSTALLATION:

MuMoD is freely available at ####. Execute the following commands to download and install NPLB:
wget ####
tar -xvf ####
cd ####
make

To execute MuMoD from anywhere export the path to MuMoD to the PATH variable.

USAGE:

To learn multiple models using mumod:
(path to MuMoD)/mumod [options]

OPTIONS

	-f filename
	   Compulsory. Data file for which motifs are to be identified. File must be in fasta format.

	-o directory
	   Valid directory name. If it exists then a new one is create with given name along with an extension number. Default directory: ###<extension> in the current working directory.

	-maskReps 0 or 1
		  Mask repeats by replacing them with 'N'. 0 implies do not mask. Default value: 1

	-r 0 or 1
	   Look for motifs in the reverse strand as well. 1 implies looking for motifs in both strand. Default value: 1

	-zoops real number between 0 and 1 (including 0 and 1)
	       Zero or one occurence per sequence. 0 means all sequences must have a motif. 1 means all sequences may not have a motif. Any value between 0 and 1 implies the probability of a sequence not having a motif. Default 0.

	-minWidth non negative integer
		  Minimum width of motifs while training models. Default value: 6

	-initialWidth non negative integer
		      Starting width of motifs while training models. Default value: 8

	-minMode non negative integer
		 Minimum number of modes possible for given dataset. Default value: 1

	-maxMode non negative integer
		 Maximum number of modes possible for given dataset. Default value: 10

	-lcount non negative integer
		Number of models to be learned while training. Only the best model is considered. Default value: 5
	
	-proc non negative integer
	      Maximum number of processors to be used for computation. Default value is the number of processors the system has.

EXAMPLES
	The following examples illustrate the usage of the options.

	To run with all the default options:
	   mumod -f example.fa

	To run for minimum 6 and maximum 12 modes without masking repeats and initial motif width of 10:
	   mumod -f example.fa -minMode 6 -maxMode 12 -maskReps 0 -initialWidth 10

	To find list of options:
	   mumod
